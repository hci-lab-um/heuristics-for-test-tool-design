# making a Business Case and ROI

Make an initial business case for the tool, including a Return on Investment (ROI) calculation, for one example see the Test Automation Patterns wiki on [Test Automation Business Case](https://testautomationpatterns.org/wiki/index.php/TEST_AUTOMATION_BUSINESS_CASE).
  
  - You may find it useful to consider your budget and a return on investment (ROI) calculation at this point, and include whether the costs will be treated as Capital Expenditure (CapEx) or Operational Expenditure (OpEx) as stakeholders may require specific expenditure types.
  - For example, if you are evaluating whether to use a tool, an early question might be to consider whether the cost of the tool is in line with budget constraints and savings goals. 
  - Alternatively if you are a tool supplier (in-house, open-source or vendor) and you are reviewing how to respond to a user change request, you might need to look at the ROI for the effort to make the change, and the benefit to the users.

Research Points:    
  - One participant working on updates to a tool said that they have to think about *``do I get payback for the amount of effort to make this change?''* when considering change requests.
  - in one case study, the participants used the heuristics to decide whether to evaluate a particular tool at all - the licencing cost for the tool was not in line with the department's financial savings goal, but the heuristics allowed them to identify alternative ways of meeting their goals. 
  - One participant commented that their organization favoured tooling expenses that could be Capital Expenditure rather than Operational Expenditure.
