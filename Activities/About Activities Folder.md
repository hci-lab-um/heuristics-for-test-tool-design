# About the Activities folder

In the activities folder, you will find documents with descriptions of the activities suggested in idea-t that help you answer the heuristic questions.

For some of these there are further explanations and examples built within idea-t.

Where examples have not yet been built, there are links to external web pages and other resources that will help you to understand and complete the activities.
