# Read Me for idea-t: a framework including 12 heuristics 
## influencing the design-evaluation and acquisition of tools to support testing

Welcome to idea-t v2, a framework of 12 heuristics, with supporting information and activities, to help you with evaluating the design of tools to support testing. It is intended to help you with decisions, whether you build, commission, acquire or use testing tools.

The flow chart shows the route through idea-t suggested on this page: A start point, a dive into idea-t, and a decision point. You have three options for starting: (1) if this is your first use of idea-t or you want a recap; (2) using a fast paths; or (3) making a plan for how you will use idea-t. Then you can use idea-t, deep diving as much as you need into the themes, keywords, heuristics and activities, and using the case studies, usage examples, and other resources to help you. Then you wrap up by making a decision.  This README provides links to pages with further information, and downloads of resources to use.

The idea-t framework has 12 heuristics in 3 themes, together with expanations, supporting activities, and resources. It is based on research in industry about testers' experiences with their tools, and is intended to help you think about factors that affect the design and attributes of tools to support testing.  The framework have been built and evaluated iteratively with input from industry practitioners and experts.  

The themes are Why?, Who? and Context?  
Here is a quick introduction to the 12 heuristics:   [◄ To Quick Start page](/How-To/Navigate-idea-t/QuickStart.md) with a brief summary of each of the heuristics, with links to more information.

There is also a workshop using a mind map which can help you work with a group to use the heuristics. The workshop is designed to take 99 minutes, and was first run at TestBash Brighton in October 2025 TBD add link to workshop materials TBD

 ### Themes and keywords
 <details><summary>Click here to see idea-t themes and keywords</summary>

 The idea-t framework has three themes: Why?, Who? and Context?

 In the research, we found that people designing and building tools and automation don't always ask "Who (else) will use this tool?"  
 People acquiring or commissioning tools and automation don't always ask "Why is this needed?" 
 We also found that the Context for using the tool or automation is not always explored.  
 These three themes are expanded in the 12 heuristics, each of which has a keyword.  
 The heuristics are grouped by theme.

[◄ Go to Heuristic H02 Why?](/Heuristics/H02-Why.md) to start examining the "Why?" theme.  Keywords are Why? Why not? and Why Else?

[◄ Go to Heuristic H02 Who?](/Heuristics/H02-Who.md) to start examining the "Who?" theme.  Keywords are Who? Experience? Communication? Learning goals? Learning preferences? Each of those also has a "not" and an "else" version.

[◄ Go to Heuristic H07 Where?](/Heuristics/H07-Where.md)  to start examining the "Conetxt?" theme. Keywords are Where?, Workflows? Risks? Autonomy? When? and How long? Each of those also has a "not" and an "else" version.

### Heuristics
<details><summary>Click here to see a list of the idea-t heuristics</summary>

The three themes cover everything you need to think about when designing or choosing a test tool, but they don't provide enough information to prompt thought.  
The idea-t framework has 12 heuristic questions intended to help you think about the tool or automation you are proposing. 
They have been distilled down from over 150 heuristics identified during the research, with topics that were frequently forgoten or problematic areas given their own heuristic under the the themes.  
Each heuristic has a longer description which includes the subquestions and explanations that cover the areas identified in the research.
Each heuristic's description also has links to activities that help you answer the questions, examples from the research, and information about which quality attributes are particularly relevant to the heuristic.

  ### Case Studies and Usage Examples
  <details><summary>Click here for idea-t cases studies and examples</summary>

  These are some of the case studies and usage scenarios run during the iterations to design, build and evaluate idea-t in industry settings. 

  TBD - add the case studies & usages to the repository and add links to the case studies

  sort out a number system useful for people using the repository rather than one that fits the research write up...

  Case Study 1 Asssessing whether to purchase a vendor tool upgrade
  
  Case Study 2 Assessing in-house automation suites and identifying areas for change
  
  Case Study 3 Tool builders performing a design review of a new feature for the tool
  
  Case Study 4 Tooling consultant planning a customer engagement
  
  Case Study 5 Deciding a tooling strategy
  
  Case Study 6 Retrospective on tool user issues

  Usage cases - choose which ones and add
