# Read Me for idea-t: a framework including 12 heuristics 
## influencing the design-evaluation and acquisition of tools to support testing

Welcome to idea-t v2, a framework of [12 heuristics](./How-To/Navigate-idea-t/QuickStart.md), with [supporting information and activities to help you navigate and answer the heuristic questions](./How-To/About-How-To-Folder.md), to help you with evaluating the design of tools to support testing. It is intended to help you with decisions, whether you build, commission, acquire or use testing tools.

The [heuristics](./Heuristics/About-Heuristics-Folder.md) are in a folder with an explanation of each one.
There is information about how to use and answer the heuristics described in the [How-To folder](./How-To/About-How-To-Folder.md), including [activities](./How-To/Activities/About-Activities-Folder.md) along with [navigation routes](./How-To/Navigate-idea-t/About-Navigating-idea-t.md) for using the heuristics in different orders and depths depending on your context, and information about the [quality attributes](./How-To/QualityAttributes/About-Quality-Attributes-Folder.md).  
These are linked to from each heuristic page. 
[Downloads](./Downloads/About-Downloads-Folder.md) of lists of the heuristics, starters for mindmaps, and a workshop you can use are also available.

There is also background to the [research](./About-the-research/About-the-research.md) and access to preprints of [publications](./Publications/About-Publications-Folder.md) about the research.

Make a plan, then deep dive, then make a decision.

<details> <summary> Click here to see the navigation flow through idea-t used in this page </summary>

The flow chart shows the route through idea-t suggested on this page: A start point, a dive into idea-t, and a decision point. You have three options for starting: (1) if this is your first use of idea-t or you want a recap; (2) using a fast path; or (3) making a detailed plan for how you will use idea-t. Then you can use idea-t, deep diving as much as you need into the themes, keywords, heuristics and activities, and using the case studies, usage examples, and other resources to help you. Then you wrap up by making a decision.  This README provides links to pages with further information, and downloads of resources to use.

  
![Navigating through idea-t: the flowchart shows three routes into the heuristics: first-time/reminders path, a fast-path, and making a plan for a deep dive. These are all routes into using the heuristics, which result in a decision point. Links to the routes are below in the text.][Navigating1](/Figures/readmepage-navigation-flow.jpg)

## (1) First use / recap
<details><summary>Click here for a summary for first use / recap / planning your use of idea-t </summary>

The idea-t framework has 12 heuristics in 3 themes, together with explanations, supporting activities, and resources. It is based on research in industry about testers' experiences with their tools, and is intended to help you think about factors that affect the design and attributes of tools to support testing.  The framework has been built and evaluated iteratively with input from industry practitioners and experts.  

The themes are Why?, Who? and Context?  

In the case studies during the research, people often started their use of idea-t by a one-hour planning session using a list of the heuristics, where they briefly discussed each heuristic, and decided who to involve in discussing the idea-t heuristics, and how long to take. The downloads include mind map skeletons and agendas that can aid this planning. 

There is also a [workshop using a mind map](./Downloads/TestBash-2025-Materials/AboutTestBashWorkshop.md) which can help you work with a group to use the heuristics. The workshop is designed to take 99 minutes, and was first run at TestBash Brighton in October 2025.

The [Navigation folder](./How-To/Navigate-idea-t/About-Navigating-idea-t.md) includes information about introducing idea-t and example routes through the heuristics.

## (2) Fast path into idea-t and the heuristics 

<details close><summary>Click here for Fast Path information</summary>
 
There is a quick introduction to the 12 heuristics on the [Quick Start page](./How-To/Navigate-idea-t/QuickStart.md) with a brief summary of each of the heuristics, with links to more information. 
There are downloadable lists of the heuristics in the [Downloads folder](./Downloads/About-Downloads-Folder.md).  
In the Downloads you will find one-page copies of the heuristics with brief notes and mind maps skeletons, along with other resources.

## (3) Planning a deep dive into idea-t framework

 <details><summary><h3>Themes and Keywords: </h3> Click here to see idea-t themes and keywords</summary>

 The idea-t framework has three themes: Why?, Who? and Context?

 In the research, we found that people designing and building tools and automation don't always ask "Who (else) will use this tool?"  
 People acquiring or commissioning tools and automation don't always ask "Why is this needed?" 
 We also found that the Context for using the tool or automation is not always explored.  
 These three themes are expanded in the 12 heuristics, each of which has a keyword.  
 The heuristics are grouped by theme.

[◄ Go to Heuristic H01 Why?](./Heuristics/H01-Why.md) to start examining the "Why?" theme.  Keywords are Why? Why not? and Why Else?

[◄ Go to Heuristic H02 Who?](./Heuristics/H02-Who.md) to start examining the "Who?" theme.  Keywords are Who? Experience? Communication? Learning goals? Learning preferences? Each of those also has a "not" and an "else" version.

[◄ Go to Heuristic H07 Where?](./Heuristics/H07-Where.md)  to start examining the "Context?" theme. Keywords are Where?, Workflows? Risks? Autonomy? When? and How long? Each of those also has a "not" and an "else" version.

<details><summary><h3>Heuristics Listed: </h3> Click here to see a list of the idea-t heuristics</summary>

The three themes cover everything you need to think about when designing or choosing a test tool, but they don't provide enough information to prompt thought.  
The idea-t framework has 12 heuristic questions intended to help you think about the tool or automation you are proposing. 
They have been distilled down from over 150 heuristics identified during the research, with topics that were frequently forgoten or problematic areas given their own heuristic under the three themes.  
Each heuristic has a longer description which includes the subquestions and explanations that cover the areas identified in the research.
Each heuristic's description also has links to activities that help you answer the questions, examples from the research, and information about which quality attributes are particularly relevant to the heuristic.

## Make a decision

Once you have worked through the heuristics and activities, use what you have discovered to decide on the most important quality attributes for the tool you are discussing, and how you can design in / evaluate those quality attributes. The quality attributes are tabulated against the heuristics in the [Quality Attributes Folder](./How-To/QualityAttributes/About-Quality-Attributes-Folder.md)
