 # Read Me for idea-t: a framework including 12 heuristics 
## influencing the design-evaluation and acquisition of tools to support testing

Welcome to idea-t v2, a framework of 12 heuristics, with supporting information and activities, to help you with evaluating the design of tools to support testing. It is intended to help you with decisions, whether you build, commission, acquire or use testing tools.

## Deep dive into the structure and background to idea-t

 ### Themes and keywords
 <details><summary>Click here to see idea-t themes and keywords</summary>

 The idea-t framework has three themes: Why?, Who? and Context?

 In the research, we found that people designing and building tools and automation don't always ask "Who (else) will use this tool?"  
 People acquiring or commissioning tools and automation don't always ask "Why is this needed?" 
 We also found that the Context for using the tool or automation is not always explored.  
 These three themes are expanded in the 12 heuristics, each of which has a keyword.  
 The heuristics are grouped by theme.

[◄ Go to Heuristic H02 Why?](../Heuristics/H02-Why.md) to start examining the "Why?" theme.  Keywords are Why? Why not? and Why Else?

[◄ Go to Heuristic H02 Who?](../Heuristics/H02-Who.md) to start examining the "Who?" theme.  Keywords are Who? Experience? Communication? Learning goals? Learning preferences? Each of those also has a "not" and an "else" version.

[◄ Go to Heuristic H07 Where?](../Heuristics/H07-Where.md)  to start examining the "Conetxt?" theme. Keywords are Where?, Workflows? Risks? Autonomy? When? and How long? Each of those also has a "not" and an "else" version.

  ### Heuristics
  <details><summary>Click here to see a list of the idea-t heuristics</summary>

  The three themes cover everything you need to think about when designing or choosing a test tool, but they don't provide enough information to prompt thought.  
  The idea-t framework has 12 heuristic questions intended to help you think about the tool or automation you are proposing. 
  They have been distilled down from over 150 heuristics identified during the research, with topics that were frequently forgoten or problematic areas given their own heuristic under the the themes.  
  Each heuristic has a longer description which includes the subquestions and explanations that cover the areas identified in the research.
  Each heuristic's description also has links to activities that help you answer the questions, examples from the research, and information about which quality attributes are particularly relevant to the heuristic.
