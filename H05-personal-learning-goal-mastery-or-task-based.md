# H5 Do these people want "tool mastery" or "task completion"?
[◄ Go back](README.md)

Theme: WHO?

## Quick Start: 

- Heuristic Question: Do these people want "tool mastery" or "task completion"? 
- People may want to master the tool/become expert or just to learn enough to enable them to complete a specific task. Consider both by personal choice and organizational pressure.
- The learning goal will be different for different people. Some people want to learn about the tool to gain mastery, while others want to learn to achieve the next task.
- This has impact on long and short term goals, on investment versus cost viewpoints.
- If just achieving the next task is the goal, then short bursts of 2 minute videos might be a good way to deliver information about the tool, or provision of wizards to step through tasks.
- Learning for mastery might require longer blocks of dedicated time, information about underlying principles, and practice sessions.
- This also relates to different people having different goals.

## Explanation and subquestions

Depending on the person and the organizational goals people may want to only learn enough to enable them to complete a specific task, or they may want to learn enough to enable expertise/mastery of a role/activity. This may be affected both by personal choice and by organizational pressure.

Think about: 
- what long and short-term goals people have with the tool, for example learning to use the tool, learning about reasons for particular approaches adopted in the tool, learning how to interpret outcomes from the tool;
- what perspectives people might have about learning, and how learning is prioritized against other work for example whether they value short-term focused, task-based knowledge, or whether they want to broaden understanding and educate over a longer term, to life-long learning; 
- what constraints on training are there (time, budget, resources) and how to overcome those;
- there may be a time gap between learning and appying - how long might that gap be, and how to bridge it;
- how to (re)find information to help at the point of completing a task;
- what types of training material are required and how you cover different personas and perspectives.

Key questions to ask yourself:
- are people more focused on the task in hand or moving to the big picture?
- are people interested in initiating improvements (self/workflow/organization)?
- do people want to complete current tasks or more interested in becoming experts/mastering work?
- have you considered the contexts for learning e.g. time available, inhibitors and enablers for learning, task specific or mastering tool/workflow? For example, whether there is a [learning culture that allows experimentation and a growth mindset](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/qz43x) - without that learning culture in the organization, people will not perceive they have time to learn a new tool. 
- have you considered accessibility and availability of the learning materials?
- what else may affect their goals for learning the tool as an inhibitor or enhancer of learning?

<summary>Research Points and Quotes</summary>

Research Point: we found that managers we interviewed had the goal of people learning just enough and coming “up to speed” and complete specific tasks. We found that test practitioners ranged in goals from task-based fast learning to wishing to study to get mastery of a tool.

*``We live in a world where people have very little time to learn how to do things''*

*``they are expected to figure it out quick and do it''*

*``pressure to keep going, learn what you need to know right now – prevents you from learning full capability, which could have helped you [strategically to improve long term]''*

*``Does competition inhibit or encourage learning in this environment/context?  [commenting on competition as enabler and about taking the poison out of competition]''*

*`` How do they judge when they can stop learning?''*

*``Will there be any training time?''*

To understand *Who learns how* you need to understand their different constraints, and different learning goals. People will have constraints on learning time, what media they can use, on their goals for learning.

Differentiate between people’s goals for mastery of a subject, which might include mastering the theory, with their need to solve a problem right now, which is likely to be task-based.

You can add these characteristics to a persona or archetype, as we show in a [worked persona example](Technique=Personas-and-Archetypes.md).

We have tabulated the [Quality in Use and Product Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md) in a priority order based on the input from industry practitioners during our research. Use that data to help you focus on the optimal product attributes to meet the QiU/UX goals for your tool. We've included quotes from practitioners that you can use to help you understand your own goals, stakeholders, and contexts, plus a cross reference between the heuristics and the quality attributes. **These may help wth persona development.**

Activities: 
- Understanding your stakeholders’ expectations for the training budget (cost and time spent) will help you understand constraints. You could [revisit stakeholders’ goals in H01](H01-why-do-we-need-this-toll.md) to understand more.
- If you are not familiar with setting learning outcomes try this set of [learning outcomes](https://www.ctl.ox.ac.uk/effective-learning-outcomes); for your training material be clear and appropriate for different personas.
