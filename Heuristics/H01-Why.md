# Heuristic H01 Why?

[◄ Back to README](../README.md)

Theme and Keyword Why?

Question: Why is this tool needed?

## Navigation hint (where you are in idea-t)

## In brief:

This heuristic prompts us to explore why a tool is needed, what goal it will help us achieve, and what problem it will solve. 

H01 Why? and H02 Who? are closely allied: different stakeholders may have different goals. Expect to iterate between Why? and Who? as you use idea-t.

  -  Why is the tool needed?
  -  What goal does it help with?
  -  What problem does it solve?
  -  What alternatives are there to the tool?
  -  Is a tool the best option to solve the problem or achieve the goal?

  -  Goals may include decreasing time to market, increasing certainty, decreasing costs.
  -  It may be necessary to make a business case for the tool, that includes the costs, benefits, and constraints experienced both with and without the tool.

The research showed that sometimes we forget to ask "why/" a tool is needed. 

Examining the goals we want to achieve and the problems we want to ovvercome help understand whether a tool will help, or not.

If you've embarked on designing, building, or choosing a new tool to help support testing... 
Think about:

-	what problem the tool is intended to solve, and whether a tool is the best option for solving that problem. 
-	the people who are testing and the organization, and how their (different) goals need supporting. 
-	enablers and blockers to meeting those goals. 
-	both the testers and the organization have motivations to adopt or to resist a new tool, and these may be the same or may conflict.

If you are tool designer or vendor, especially if you will not use the tool yourselves, you also ask this question as:
"Why do *they* need this tool?" 
They might be different users, different customers, and other stakeholders.

Also ask "Why else?" and "Why not?"

### Sub questions and alternative questions

Key questions to ask yourself:
-	Is there a problem to solve?
-	Is it organizational or technical or something else?
-	What is missing from the existing toolset?
-	Why does the tester need the tool?
-	Why does the organization want the tool?

### Role-based alternative questions

For tool users: Why do we need this tool?
-	Will this tool support what we are doing/want to achieve?

For tool suppliers: 
- Why do our customers need this tool?
- Why do we want to supply this tool?
- Can you design the tool to increase productivity?
-	Can you design the tool to reduce risk and increase value?
-	Can you design the tool to improve the reach and certainty of people’s work?


### Not? 
Why not? 

- What are the reasons we might not need this tool?
-	Does use of this tool cause any breach of ethical goals?
- What happens if (part of) the tool is not used?
- Should we use the tool at all?


### Else?
Why else?
-	Are there contradicting goals from different parts of the organization?

  </summary> 

  - Research Point: In the research leading to the design of these heuristics, we found there are often conflicting goals and expectations for the tools, and different perceptions of what problems needed resolving to enable improvement in working practices. 
  - Conflicting or unclear goals mean tool acquisition may be done in a short-term mindset. 
  - In some studies, tools were not the solution to the problem the participant was trying to address.

### Usage cases

In one usage, the heuristics started to be introduced late and the participant identified that asking **H01 Why?** can be difficult as it might force a change of mind set or a change of direction, by acknowledging different people will have different goals. While that could be exactly what is needed, it is also difficult to do because people are reluctant to change:

'In later stages, however, this question may need to be adapted. Once discussions shift toward solutions, it can be challenging to steer back to the broader "why." Different personas appear at different stages with a unique perspective on the purpose of the tool. For instance, the buyer persona’s "why" may differ significantly from that of the tool's end users. To fully understand why the tool is needed, it’s essential to ask about challenges and goals from multiple stakeholders.'

In this scenario, the participant decided to go with the Why? and Which tool? decisions as they were in place, and use the heuristics to guide their own work in planning future workshops.

### Quotes from research participants

"There may be several organizations - even within one organization - with conflicting goals for the same tool [example given of password control tool] Audit versus Dev may have different views about how that might be used"

"muddling through - don't have a goal ... just want to do things ... get things done"

"change always comes with some resistance, Discussing and setting a clear, shared goal we got a better understanding and purpose to find energy and time and money to finish the transition"

" I would suggest we stop seeing tools as our main goal that will save us, or do the job for us"
