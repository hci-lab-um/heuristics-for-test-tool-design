# About the Heuristics Folder

This heuristics folder contains a document for each heuristic, with explanations, additional questions, and pointers to activities to help you answer the heuristic questions. Links are listed below to each heuristic.

If you just want a list of the heuristics with brief explanations, or a mindmap, instead look in the [Downloads Folder](About-Downloads-Folder.md)
