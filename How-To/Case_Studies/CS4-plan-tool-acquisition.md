# Case Study 4 Summary: Heuristics Applied to Consultancy Pre-Sales Planning

## Method

This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics by two consultants specialising in tooling for agile and DevOps projects in Scandinavia. The study took place between July and October 2024. The consultants work with customers evaluating and choosing tools, guiding them through evaluation, selection, and implementation processes. Their approach is deliberately tool-agnostic, focused on solving problems rather than promoting specific solutions, with an observation that approximately 80% of the time, what clients need is not actually a tool but rather process or communication change.

The primary participant used the heuristics to plan pre-sales meetings with potential customers, intending to use them more extensively in subsequent discovery workshops if engagements proceeded. The consultants' typical engagement process involves five distinct stages: pre-sales and kickoff to understand customer goals; discovery through workshops and interviews to understand people, context and workflows; proof of concept through workshops and demo building to test tool alignment with customer goals; end-user training involving learning experience design and delivery; and deployment through pilots, implementation choices, and rollout.

The participant was interested in lightweight heuristic application during pre-sales, with more detailed use in later stages, anticipating spiralling, iterative application. Data was collected through planning meetings between the consultant and researcher during July and August 2024, visual mapping exercises on a digital whiteboard, participant diary entries, and evaluation discussions in October 2024. The consultant also sought to understand whether the heuristics could support onboarding and upskilling new consultants by providing a framework for customer engagement.

## Results

### Planning Phase

During initial assessment, the consultant created a visual mapping of the heuristics against their consultancy process stages, finding the existing GitHub repository too text-heavy and requiring visualisation for practical application. This mapping exercise identified which heuristics were most relevant at each engagement stage.

For pre-sales and discovery phases, the consultant identified a core subset of three heuristics as most valuable: H01 (Why?), H02 (Who?), and H08 (Workflows?). These questions help establish initial understanding of customer fundamental needs, allowing definition of scope for further discovery and assessment. The consultant emphasised that at pre-sales and discovery stages, the question set should remain relatively small, focusing on providing overall understanding of why, who, and context, with detailed exploration following in subsequent phases.

Two heuristics were not initially planned for use: H07 (Where?) and H12 (How long?), as the consultant did not find them understandable at first assessment. However, subsequent discussion identified that H07 might be applicable to customer workshops focused on cost and break-even points, distinguishing customer concerns from end-user concerns about usability and experience. The consultant suggested H11 (When?) should also include consideration of "How much?"

### Detailed Heuristic Feedback

H01 (Why do we need this tool?) was identified as fundamental for first customer interactions, enabling understanding of business needs driving change. The consultant noted this format suits initial meetings where customers explain their interest in a tool. However, a critical insight emerged: in later engagement stages, once discussions shift toward solutions, steering back to the broader "why" becomes challenging. Different personas appearing at different stages bring unique perspectives on tool purpose, with purchaser motivations often differing significantly from end-user needs. The consultant recommended a new sub-question: "Should we use the tool at all?"

H02 (Who will use or be affected by the tool?) proved particularly relevant when engaging with purchasing decision-makers. The consultant highlighted the value of the note in the heuristic explanation that people who identify problems may not be those who need to solve them, describing this as requiring careful exploration with customers. Stakeholder mapping exercises conducted early help identify key individuals for discovery, though customers may not initially recognise all relevant roles, making it valuable to provide examples based on past experience. This feedback was particularly significant for the research, as it indicated that the "Who?" question is more generally forgotten than previously understood from earlier data.

H08 (What workflows will the tool be part of?) was positioned as core for mapping current state with key stakeholders. The consultant would use current state mapping exercises to explore this heuristic, understanding both big picture and role-specific workflows. The consultant emphasised the crucial need at this stage to loop back to questions of why, who, and broader context to understand relevant motivations and connections, with current state mapping capturing individual activities and identifying process bottlenecks.

H10 (What work styles are acceptable in those workflows and teams?) provided useful sub-questions about team organisation and individual autonomy over tools and ways of working. Understanding organisational autonomy levels helps clarify whether tool adoption is team-level or intended for organisation-wide practices, allowing definition of pilot context and expansion planning.

For other heuristics, the consultant found it more challenging to draw direct connections to pre-sales or discovery phases.

## Impact and Evaluation

The consultant concluded that overall, heuristics offer a consistent, science-backed approach to understanding business and user needs, supporting customers on their tool adoption journey and helping consultants make lasting impact. However, the practical application revealed significant challenges.

The original plan to use heuristics in both planning and conducting customer meetings was only partially realised due to customer demands and behaviour. A customer who had been expected to participate in discovery workshops instead demanded immediate training on a predetermined tool, then subsequently characterised the tool as problematic when it failed to meet unexamined needs. The consultant described this as the customer taking "180-degree turns" in direction, making it "too late to take a step back" to investigate root cause problems.

This experience illuminated several barriers to heuristic adoption. The novelty of introducing new methods proved difficult when customers have preconceived solutions. Trust emerged as a critical precondition - both trust among workshop participants in each other, and trust in new methodological approaches. Without trust, participants prove unwilling to discuss underlying problems, preferring to ask solution-focused questions because sharing problems feels unsafe. As the consultant noted, "When we have the trust, then we can have the workshop."

The consultant observed that vocalising problems from a tool perspective rather than investigating root causes makes it difficult to reverse course once a tool has been selected. Generic demonstrations are easy to provide but don't match customer needs, yet customers resistant to discovery workshops still expect this approach. The consultant characterised this pattern using the concept of "heroes and villains" - tools initially perceived as heroic solutions rapidly becoming perceived villains when they fail to deliver on unrealistic expectations.

Additional barriers included perceived lack of time, with the extensive heuristics repository creating reluctance to engage; changing management directives overriding structured approaches; and customer attitudes toward innovation, with later-stage adopters looking for tried and tested methods rather than novel frameworks.

Improvements identified from this case study included creating more visualisations and making them easier to find in the repository; developing a fast-path subset for early customer engagement; adding explicit guidance on building trust and introducing new methods; showing more clearly the iterative nature of revisiting questions as understanding deepens; and potentially developing a "how to" guide specifically for introducing new consultants to customer engagement using the heuristics framework.

The consultant expressed interest in potential collaboration on introducing the heuristics into wider industry use through blog posts and consultancy process documentation.
