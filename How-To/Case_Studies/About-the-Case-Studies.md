# About the Case Studies

The six case studies are:

- an evaluation by a tool-using organisation of a vendor tool;
- a review of in-house test automation suites by the automation team leaders and test architect responsible for them;
- a vendor review of the design for a new feature for a tool;
- a planning session for a tool acquisition;
- setting an organisational tooling strategy;
- reviewing customer queries about a tool to look for patterns.

They are summarised below, with links to the full case study descriptions.

## Case Study 1 Evaluating a Vendor Tool

This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics in an industry setting where a multi-national entertainment company assessed whether to replace their existing free accessibility testing tool with a commercial vendor's integrated solution. The participant used the heuristics across five evaluation stages during February-April 2024. 

The heuristics proved highly effective, achieving consistent scores of 5/5 for understandability and flexibility. Four core heuristics (Why do we need this tool? Who will use it? Where will it be used? What workflows will it be part of?) generated critical insights that redirected the organization's focus from tool acquisition to addressing fundamental process and communication gaps between departments. The evaluation revealed that accessibility issues identified by engineering teams were deprioritized, while the UX department's accessibility work remained disconnected from implementation teams.

The participant concluded that improving cross-departmental workflows and communication offered greater value than purchasing the expensive tool upgrade, resulting in cost savings of 20,000 Euros while better addressing the underlying organizational challenges.

Case Study 2 Précis: Heuristics Applied to In-House Test Automation Review
This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics in reviewing three in-house built test automation suites of varying maturity at a multi-national entertainment company. A participant with prior experience of the heuristics facilitated a workshop with an automation manager and two team leads in April 2024.
A key finding was that suite maturity directly influenced which heuristics were most relevant and how deeply they required discussion. Core heuristics addressing Why, Who, Where, Workflows, and When were consistently valuable across all three reviews. Heuristics addressing communication and learning preferences were not used in any review, as participants felt confident in those areas.
The primary outcome was that changes to ways of working, rather than changes to the automation suites themselves, represented the greatest opportunity for improvement. Automation was characterised as an amplifier of existing systems, requiring sound processes and communication as its foundation.

Case Study 3 Précis: Heuristics Applied to New Feature Design
This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics in the design of two new features for an existing commercial SaaS test tool, at a vendor organisation whose users are predominantly non-technical. Three participants, including the organisation's director, support lead, and lead front-end developer, applied the heuristics across planning and design meetings between February and May 2024.
The heuristics facilitated structured reflection on design decisions, prompting the organisation to distinguish between the needs of tool purchasers and end users, and to recognise the diversity of user backgrounds across their customer base. The primary outcome was recognition that prototypes needed validation with both customers and end users before implementation.
The organisation's high UX maturity meant the heuristics largely formalised existing good practice. Sub-questions proved more valuable than top-level heuristics in this maintenance context, and differentiated guidance for new build versus maintenance scenarios was identified as a key improvement needed.

## Case Study 4 Planning a Pre-sales for a Tool Acquisition Consultancy

<details><summary> Click here for case study 4 short précis  </summary>

This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics by two consultants working in Scandinavia, focusing on tooling for agile and DevOps projects. The consultants used the heuristics to plan pre-sales meetings with potential customers for tool evaluation and selection projects between July and October 2024.

The consultant identified a core subset of heuristics most valuable for early customer engagement: H01 (Why?), H02 (Who?), and H08 (Workflows?). These questions helped establish fundamental customer needs and define the scope for deeper discovery. The consultant created a visual mapping of heuristics against their consultancy process stages, finding the framework provided a science-backed approach to understanding business and user needs.

Challenges identified included difficulty introducing new methods to customers with preconceived solutions, the need for trust before engaging with structured questioning, and customer reluctance to participate in discovery workshops when already committed to specific tools.

## Case Study 5 Setting a Tooling Strategy

<details><summary> Click here for case study 5 short précis </summary>

This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics by a testing consultant planning advice on test automation tooling strategy for an enterprise-level organisation with approximately 5,000 engineers. The study took place between June and August 2024.

The consultant used the heuristics to challenge their thinking while planning for a significant organisational restructure that shifted testing from a specialised role to an activity performed by all engineers. The heuristics were assessed against the consultant's existing internalised practice, revealing substantial alignment while surfacing new perspectives.

H12 (How long will the tool be used?) generated the most significant insight, prompting consideration of decommissioning costs and long-term implications. The consultant described it as "blew my mind - such a great question." Four heuristics were deemed not useful in this context. The consultant concluded the heuristics would be valuable for learning, stakeholder conversations, and ensuring comprehensive consideration of tooling strategy.

## Case Study 6 Assement of Customer Queries About a Tool 

(Précis generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5, part of Anthropic's Claude 4.5 model family) 

<details><summary> Click here for case study 6 short précis </summary>

This case study examined whether tool evaluation heuristics could have prevented customer issues if applied during design. A test tool vendor in the Netherlands retrospectively reviewed 100 customer issues from the previous 18 months (37 improvement requests, 37 user questions, 26 technical support queries) with the study date of October-November 2024.

Analysis found that 42% of issues had medium or high heuristic applicability, suggesting they might have been prevented or mitigated through earlier heuristic application. The top three applicable heuristics were H08 (Workflows), H04 (Communication preferences), and H06 (Learning preferences). Both high-importance issues in the sample had highly applicable heuristics.

The organisation concluded the heuristics would have prevented some issues and provided deeper understanding of others, particularly around workflows and communication. However, knowing what needed doing differed from having time to act. The participant preferred using heuristics during design rather than retrospectively.
