This case study was: Evaluating a test tool for use in industry setting

This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics in an industry setting where a multi-national entertainment company assessed whether to replace their existing free accessibility testing tool with a commercial vendor's integrated solution. The participant used the heuristics across five evaluation stages during February-April 2024. 

The heuristics proved highly effective, achieving consistent scores of 5/5 for understandability and flexibility. Four core heuristics (Why do we need this tool? Who will use it? Where will it be used? What workflows will it be part of?) generated critical insights that redirected the organization's focus from tool acquisition to addressing fundamental process and communication gaps between departments. The evaluation revealed that accessibility issues identified by engineering teams were deprioritized, while the UX department's accessibility work remained disconnected from implementation teams.

The participant concluded that improving cross-departmental workflows and communication offered greater value than purchasing the expensive tool upgrade, resulting in cost savings of 20,000 Euros while better addressing the underlying organizational challenges.
