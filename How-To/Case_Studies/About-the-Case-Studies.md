## Case Study 1 Evaluating a Vendor Tool

This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics in an industry setting where a multi-national entertainment company assessed whether to replace their existing free accessibility testing tool with a commercial vendor's integrated solution. The participant used the heuristics across five evaluation stages during February-April 2024. 

The heuristics proved highly effective, achieving consistent scores of 5/5 for understandability and flexibility. Four core heuristics (Why do we need this tool? Who will use it? Where will it be used? What workflows will it be part of?) generated critical insights that redirected the organization's focus from tool acquisition to addressing fundamental process and communication gaps between departments. The evaluation revealed that accessibility issues identified by engineering teams were deprioritized, while the UX department's accessibility work remained disconnected from implementation teams.

The participant concluded that improving cross-departmental workflows and communication offered greater value than purchasing the expensive tool upgrade, resulting in cost savings of 20,000 Euros while better addressing the underlying organizational challenges.

Case Study 2 Précis: Heuristics Applied to In-House Test Automation Review
This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics in reviewing three in-house built test automation suites of varying maturity at a multi-national entertainment company. A participant with prior experience of the heuristics facilitated a workshop with an automation manager and two team leads in April 2024.
A key finding was that suite maturity directly influenced which heuristics were most relevant and how deeply they required discussion. Core heuristics addressing Why, Who, Where, Workflows, and When were consistently valuable across all three reviews. Heuristics addressing communication and learning preferences were not used in any review, as participants felt confident in those areas.
The primary outcome was that changes to ways of working, rather than changes to the automation suites themselves, represented the greatest opportunity for improvement. Automation was characterised as an amplifier of existing systems, requiring sound processes and communication as its foundation.

Case Study 3 Précis: Heuristics Applied to New Feature Design
This case study examined the application of twelve tool evaluation heuristics in the design of two new features for an existing commercial SaaS test tool, at a vendor organisation whose users are predominantly non-technical. Three participants, including the organisation's director, support lead, and lead front-end developer, applied the heuristics across planning and design meetings between February and May 2024.
The heuristics facilitated structured reflection on design decisions, prompting the organisation to distinguish between the needs of tool purchasers and end users, and to recognise the diversity of user backgrounds across their customer base. The primary outcome was recognition that prototypes needed validation with both customers and end users before implementation.
The organisation's high UX maturity meant the heuristics largely formalised existing good practice. Sub-questions proved more valuable than top-level heuristics in this maintenance context, and differentiated guidance for new build versus maintenance scenarios was identified as a key improvement needed.
