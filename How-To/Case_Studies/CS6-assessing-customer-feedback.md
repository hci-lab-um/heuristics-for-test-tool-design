## Method

This case study examined whether tool evaluation heuristics could have prevented or mitigated customer issues if applied during tool design. A test tool vendor based in the Netherlands, who had previously participated in a case study using the heuristics during new feature design, retrospectively reviewed customer issues from the previous 18 months against version 1.4 of the heuristics in October and November 2024.

The organisation is a small, focused team with development, testing, and UX design experience, operating in the SaaS model with two-week release cycles for smaller changes and longer cycles for substantial changes. Their customer base includes public authorities, charities, and commercial organisations across mainland Europe. The tool is specifically designed for ease of use by non-technical staff, with approximately 70% of end users having no IT background. Users include medical staff, warehouse operatives, and other non-ICT staff as well as specialist testers.

The research hypothesis was that applying heuristics at design stage might reduce post-release issues. The organisation typically receives customer and user issues through multiple channels: improvement requests from specific clients or groups of customers, technical support queries, user questions for clarification (particularly after releases with new features), and questions about why requested functionality has not yet been implemented. Return on investment considerations influence which improvements are implemented, based on development effort versus effect for both organisation and customer.

Over the previous 18 months, 429 issues had been raised: 35 improvement requests, 26 technical support queries, 216 user questions, and 92 bug reports. For the retrospective analysis, a sample of 100 was selected comprising all improvement requests, all technical support queries, and user questions selected by date order from newest backwards until reaching 100 total. Bug reports were excluded as primarily coding errors less likely to be addressed through design heuristics, whereas improvement requests, technical support queries, and user questions were more likely to indicate issues addressable through design of interfaces, workflows, help documents, or training materials.

Data protection and commercial confidentiality were critical concerns, as the issue reports contained customer names, emails, and intellectual property. The reports were typically in Dutch rather than English, and automatic translation raised security concerns. Therefore, the participant conducted the analysis independently in-house, spending 2.5 hours reviewing issues against the twelve top-level heuristics. Each issue was assessed for importance (high, medium, low based on severity, priority, reputation impact, market share, customer impact, and participant judgement) and for which heuristics, if any, might have helped prevent or mitigate it, with an assessment of applicability level (high, medium, low, none). Total case study time including planning and follow-up discussion was 6.5 person-hours.

## Results

### Issue Importance Distribution

The sample contained 2 high-importance issues (both improvement requests), 24 medium-importance issues (11 improvement requests, 5 user questions, 8 technical support), and 74 low-importance issues (24 improvement requests, 32 user questions, 18 technical support). The ratio was 1 high to 12 medium to 37 low importance issues. The participant initially found the small number of high-importance issues surprising but recognised this resulted from excluding bug reports, as most questions do not halt business operations.

### Heuristic Applicability

Overall, 14% of issues had high heuristic applicability and 28% had medium applicability, suggesting that heuristic use might have had significant effect in pre-empting 42% of issues. The participant noted that for the 14 issues with high applicability, the heuristics would likely have made a large difference, and the 28 with medium applicability were also useful, though acknowledging this indicated correlation rather than proven causation.

Both high-importance issues had highly applicable heuristics, suggesting they could have been prevented through earlier heuristic application. For medium-importance issues, 25% had high applicability, 42% had medium applicability, and 13% had low applicability. For low-importance issues, 8% had high applicability, 24% had medium applicability, and 27% had low applicability.

Heuristics were most applicable to improvement requests, as would be expected given their design focus. For improvement requests and user questions, more than half of issues had applicable heuristics. For technical support issues, around half had applicable heuristics.

### Key Heuristics Identified

The top three heuristics by both frequency of identification and issue importance were H08 (Workflows - applicable to 25 issues), H04 (Communication preferences and needs - 12 issues), and H06 (Learning preferences - 9 issues).

H08's prominence was particularly significant. It had been identified in the earlier case study with this organisation as a key area requiring attention. Since the issues analysed predated that earlier study, the retrospective results confirmed it as a key area needing address. The participant noted the discussion of H08 during and after the earlier study as highly useful for engaging the team in understanding wider ramifications of interconnected workflows and tools, extending well beyond their specific tool.

H04, considered potentially interesting during the earlier case study and scored 5/5 for usefulness during new feature design, proved applicable to multiple issues, confirming its value. H06, which the organisation had proposed combining with H04 and H05 during the earlier study, proved applicable to 9 issues and scored quite differently from the related heuristics, suggesting value in keeping them separated to ensure each aspect receives distinct consideration.

Other heuristics showed varied patterns. H01 and H02, which the organisation already knew well and had infused into their thinking patterns, had zero associated issues, confirming their established good practice in these areas. H09, scored low (1/5) for usefulness in the earlier study, proved applicable to 5 issues, indicating an area potentially worth more discussion with colleagues.

### Issues Without Applicable Heuristics

Thirty-five issues (35%) were judged unrelated to any heuristic. The participant noted that many represented strategic decisions already made - areas where the organisation had determined not to implement requested changes regardless of heuristic insights. Some reflected situations where users should consult existing documentation.

However, analysis of these non-applicable issues revealed interesting patterns around quality attributes, suggesting potential gaps in heuristic explanations. Among medium-importance issues without applicable heuristics, 4 concerned interoperability or compatibility and 1 concerned security. Among low-importance issues without applicable heuristics, 10 concerned interoperability or compatibility, 2 concerned performance, 2 concerned scalability, and 3 concerned security. These quality attributes might warrant more explicit coverage in heuristic explanations, particularly under H08, H09, H10, and H11.

## Impact and Evaluation

The participant concluded that using the heuristics would have avoided high-importance issues and provided information to help think about medium and low-importance issues. They might have examined workflows earlier and spent more time on communication and learning preferences. However, they drew a crucial distinction between knowledge and capacity: some work identified as needed had been in planning for several years. The problem was not just knowing what needed doing but having time to do it. The heuristics would have provided more knowledge but not necessarily enabled action.

The participant described the retrospective exercise as going "deeper than expected," changing inbuilt heuristics where evidence-based ones gave different results, allowing issues to be seen "in a different light" by embedding the heuristics. They emphasised that heuristics are not "black and white" rules but tools for exploring different ways to answer questions with varying levels of applicability depending on context.

The workflow heuristic proved particularly valuable, allowing deep dives into system interconnections and revealing aspects not previously considered. The participant noted that simplicity is always central to their design, and understanding limits is crucial.

Comparing the earlier case study's usefulness scores with the retrospective applicability scores revealed coherent patterns. High usefulness scores in the earlier study reflected both areas of established confidence (low issue counts retrospectively) and areas of known needed action (H08's high issue count). The participant preferred using heuristics during design stage rather than retrospectively, noting that retrospective application was less useful and probably a one-off exercise, whereas design-stage application was repeatable.

The organisation planned to create a tailored short list for their design process, incorporating the heuristics alongside other considerations, and make them accessible via internal wiki to keep them "top of mind" during design work.
