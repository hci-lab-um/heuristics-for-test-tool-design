# About the How To Folder

This folder contains materials to help you get started with, navigate and use idea-t.

This includes (will include) links to 

- [Navigation aids](./Navigate-idea-t/About-Navigating-idea-t.md) to show routes around idea-t and the heuristics, including a Quick Start page;
- [Activities](./Activities/About-Activities-Folder.md) to help you answer the heuristic questions;
- Information about [quality attributes](./QualityAttributes/About-Quality-Attributes-Folder.md) that are associated with each heuristic;

If you want working materials, meeting agendas, mindmap start kits, or a list of the heuristics as a document, you will find them in the [Downloads folder](../Downloads/AboutDownloads-Folder.md).
