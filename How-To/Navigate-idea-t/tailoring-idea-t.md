# Tailoring idea-t and the heuristics

This section has notes on tailoring idea-t and a mini usage case.

<summary>Tailoring hints </summary>

Don't be limited by the questions or the activities list - you won't have to do them all, and you may have preferred alternatives.
You can add to them, tailor them, or combine them to suit your context. If your context changes, go back to the original 12 just to re-check your tailoring.

You can make your organization a tailored heuristics checklist based on these heuristics and the sub-questions under each heuristic - we've found that depending on context sometimes people have extra subquestions and want to split one main heuristics into two, or that they feel they have a good understanding in a particular area and want to combine heuristics. 

Check the research points and explanations first - for example one case study participant wanted to combine **H04 Communication** with **H06 Learning preferences** but the research data indicates that communication preferences changed when people were learning new things, for example from paired to solo or vice versa, and from exploratory to guided or vice versa, we recommend keeping them separate.
If you do tailor, we recommend you come back to the original list and review your choices periodically, to make sure you are still on track.

In another case study, the heuristics H07 and H11 were combined: in that specific context asking **H07 Where?** dictated which environment was to be used, and asking **H11 When?** implied which test stage, which linked to a specific environment. In other case studies, these two questions were clearly different and needed to be answered separately.

If you want to tailor the heuristics to suit your context, please do - see the [licence](../../LICENSE) to see how to do that and remember to reshare your versions and tailoring.

<summary>Mini usage case</summary>
  
One organization in a case study used the heuristics in a 1 hour discussion of a mature automation suite to ask ``do we all still agree we are going in the right direction'' and confirmed this, while another automation suite in a similar meeting identified some key communication and process challenges that were blocking progress and required a deep dive discussion - this was rescheduled for another day.
