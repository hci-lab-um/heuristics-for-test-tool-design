# Navigating idea-t if you are designing or building a tool or automation suite

- Open source tool design
- In-house tool design
- Maintenance considerations

## Tool vendor designing or building a test tool

<details close>
  <summary>Tool vendor designing tool</summary>
  
You are designing and building this tool for someone else to use. How well do you understand the people who will be affected?
We found during the research that people *buying* tools often forget to ask *Why* they needed the tool, and people *building* tools often forgot to ask *Who for?*

You might find it useful to start with the *Who?* questions and once you have identified your people, then ask *Why?* for each group of people. You will want to focus the *``Why?''* heuristic H01 on the people who will use the tool, but you also need to think about the goals for your commercial stakeholders.

You need to think carefully about how long the tool will be maintained and supported, and the ROI on this process and for the tool.

Your order to answer the heuristic questions could be: H02, then H01, then H12, followed by H03 to H11.

## Open source test tool design and build

<details close>
  <summary>Open Source designing tool</summary>
  
You are designing and building this tool for someone else to use. How well do you understand the people who will be affected?
We found during the research that people *buying* tools often forget to ask *Why* they needed the tool, and people *building* tools often forgot to ask *Who for?*
In this case you may also have other people taking part in building and maintaining the tool - designing for maintainability will be important.

You might find it useful to start with the *who?* questions and once you have identified your people, then ask *Why?* for each group of people. You need to focus the *``Why?''* heuristic H01 on the people how will use the tool, which may be yourself, and people with other requirements and preferences.

You need to think carefully about how long the tool will be maintained and supported, and the ROI on this process and for the tool.

ROI may not be cash-related - think about how much time the community around the tool will want to spend working on it.

*''The 12 heuristics of tool development helped me in preparing the workshop for the [tool] by checking what I did and did not think about this tool when I came up with the idea. During the workshop the 12 heuristics were available to the attendees and they could use it as inspiration when brainstorming about problems we would have to tackle when developing the tool.''*

## In-house test tools

<details close>
  <summary>In-house tool designing</summary>
  
You probably know *why* you want to build this tool, possibly with yourself in mind as the primary person using the tool, but have you thought carefully about *who else* might want to use it and why they might want to use it? Those other people may have different answers to the *'Why?'* heuristic so think about it both as 'Why do we...?' and 'Why do they...?'

It could be *anyone in the organization* which might be too hard to think about, so instead we use personas or archetypes to help us think about groups of people, and the different contexts in which they will use the tool.

If you are building the tool just for yourself, read the 12 heuristic questions, think about "who else?" and then put the heuristics to one side. When you find other people are using the tool, and you are having to support them, then spend some time to address the heuristics. Do not lose the opportunity to build yourself a useful tool, but do be prepared to come back to this. Research showed us that the heuristic questions would have changed how people might build a tool for themselves, and also could look daunting; *'If I had read the heuristics before I started I would have done things differently ... but maybe I wouldn't have built the tool...'* Don't lose the chance to build yourself a `quick and dirty' tool that saves you time. But do come back to these heuristics when other people start adopting the tool and you have to adapt and support it.

If you are building a tool for your team to use, discuss the 12 heuristic questions together and use them to guide the design.  Suggest you set a time box for the discussion and from that decide on the ROI for this process - how much time do you need to spend on the tool design? Drop into the detailed explanations for each heuristic to pick up on activities that look particularly pertinent.

If you are building a tool for multiple teams, to use across the organization, then you need to spend time on the design, do some of the suggested activities to understand the personas in your organization, and their various contexts. Follow the generic order for the questions, including the loopbacks between questions that you will find in the detailed explanations.

## Using the Heuristics to Support Changes and Maintenance Decisions

<details close> <summary>Changes and Maintenance</summary>
  
We found when evaluating the heuristics in the industry case studies that teams maintaining tools or mature automation suites found they already had discussed some of the heuristics topics. However, which ones they needed to disucss in detail was *very* context dependent even within one organization. It was useful for these groups to have an initial meeting where they discussed all the heuristics fairly quickly to select which ones to then discuss in detail. One case study participant noted that their team had been: *'working together for years'* so they had a through understanding of each other and of the people using the automation, including their communication and learning preferences; they noted *'if a new person joined, it would be different.'*
