# About Navigating idea-t

This folder contains information to help you navigate idea-t and the heuristics.  At the heart of idea-t are the 12 heuristic questions; the rest of idea-t includes guidelines to help you use the heuristics.

This folder includes:

- [Quick Start Guide](QuickStart.md) (briefly introduced below)
- [Introducing the heuristics into your organisation](introducing-the-heuristics.md) (briefly introduced below)
- [Notes on tailoring idea-t and the heuristics to fit your organisation](tailoring-idea-t-md)
- Routes through idea-t for different purposes
- etc.. TBD

We recommend you re-use the heuristics at intervals, perhaps have a quick discussion at regular intervals to decide if you need a deep dive into any of them.

You might want to adopt them as an agenda for a planning meeting, or as a checklist to aid fast insights, to help you decide which heuristics you want to use for a deep dive. Timebox that activity. Materials in the [Downloads folder](../../Downloads/About-Downloads-Folder.md) and the [QuickStart](QuickStart.md) will help you.

You might want to time box how long you spend on each theme, explore them, and then decide whether to allow more time to work more deeply on discovery activities. One person who [used a cut-down version of the heuristics as a simple checklist for part of a workshop](https://huddle.eurostarsoftwaretesting.com/ladybug-open-source-project-kick-off/) said *"They just help you talk about things."* You can keep it as simple as that!

<summary>Introducing idea-t and the heuristics </summary> 
[Introducing the heuristics into an organisation](introducing-the-heuristics.md) may require a little planning; you need to build trust through experimenting with them.

You might find the best way to introduce them is to use the heuristics as a meeting agenda when discussing a tool or automation suite, or by using a workshop to start - materials for these are in the [Downloads folder](../../Downloads/About-Downloads-Folder.md)
