# Introducing the heuristics into your organization

These heuristics are evidence-based and validated, and also new - at the point of writing this note, not fully published - and certainly if you are reading this, new to you and your organization.

People are reluctant to change, and can be reluctant to try new things, so how can you get your colleagues to try the heuristics?

## Building trust

You need to build your own trust in the heuristic questions, and you need to allow other people to build their trust.

## Do it yourself...

Step 1 could be for you to use the heuristics as a checklist to help you plan for a meeting you will be in to disucss tools and automation.
What questions do you want to ask? What parts of the research evidence in the repository might help you make points? WHat activities might be useful?

## Use them as a meeting agenda...

Step 2 might be to suggest the questions as a [meeting agenda or quick checklist](Heuristics-fast-path.md../../Downloads/About-Downloads-Folder.md) to use with one or two collegues. You can time box to an hours meeting, to identfy which of the questions you need to deep dive into.

## How quickly do people adopt new ideas?

Something to remember is that some people adopt new ideas and methods more quickly than others. 
If you bring a new untried idea to your team, are they people who relish a new idea, or do they prefer to wait and see if it works somewhere else?
Maybe it is worth asking people if they would be interested in trialling the heuristics, and reporting back to others - it is likely to be [early adopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter) who join in first.

## We'll try anything once...

Another group who may be willing to try something new are those who have realised they have a problem to solve - they may be willing to make a small, timeboxed experiment - maybe a half hour meeting to skim the 12 heuristics questions (in the words of one boss I had 'I'll try anything now') 


## Heroes and Villains...

Take care! 
Do not oversell the heuristics and don't let other people do that either - heroes so quickly become villains when a proposed solution does not work. 
The heuristics are a set of questions to get you and your team thinking - the answers depend on your team collectively, and may be different to any of the examples in the repository.
Above all else, be thoughtful about how you apply this.
