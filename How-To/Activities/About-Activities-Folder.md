# About the Activities folder

In the activities folder, you will find documents with descriptions of the activities suggested in idea-t that help you answer the heuristic questions.

For some of these there are further explanations and examples built within idea-t.

Where examples have not yet been built, or where good resources are already available, there are links to external web pages and other resources that will help you to understand and complete the activities.

The table below lists the activities explained in this repository and the heuristics they help with.

| Activity                           | Heuristics                  |

|Persona development | H02, H03, H04, H05, H06|



The table below lists the heuristics, and for each one, a link to one or more suggested activities either described in this repository, or a link to an external source of information.
