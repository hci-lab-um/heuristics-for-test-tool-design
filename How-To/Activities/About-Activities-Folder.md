# About the Activities folder

In the activities folder, you will find documents with descriptions of the activities suggested in idea-t that help you answer the heuristic questions.

For some of these, there are further explanations and examples built within idea-t.

Where examples have not yet been built, or where good resources are already available, there are links to external web pages and other resources that will help you to understand and complete the activities.

The table below lists the heuristics, and for each one, a link to one or more suggested activities either described in this repository, or a link to an external source of information.

Some activities are helpful for more than one heuristic, or are valuable to revisit and build across several heuristics. These include:

- Persona development which helps with all the Who? questions; each of the Who? questions adds more depth to the personas.
- Business case and ROI is useful to consider during H01, H05 and H12.
- Stakeholder mapping is worth revisiting throughout as you discover more stakeholders and personas.
- Skills gap analysis helps with both H05 and H06.
- Communication preferences can be different during normal work (H04) to preferences when learning new information or activities (H06).

### Accessibility

Consideration of accessiblity is part of thinking about people's communication needs and preferences, and should always be part of the design and evaluation of any tool.

Disabilities can be permanent, temporary or situational. They can be physical, cognitive, learning, neurological, apply to any of the senses.
International and government bodies have standards, laws, guidelines and guidance materials.

Guidelines:
- Use the [Microsoft Inclusive Design Methodology](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/) to guide your design process by following their [Inclusive 101 guidebook](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf);
- A fun workshop developed by the [Accessible Reality](http://accessible-reality.org/) team supported by the University of Dundee is the “Pirates” workshop which helps you think about the different types of access needs that a person may have.
