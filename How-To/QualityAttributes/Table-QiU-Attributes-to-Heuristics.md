# Quality in Use Attributes Explained, with the Heuristics that Point To Each Attribute


|Attribute         | Comment | Which heuristics are affected? |
|:-----------------|:--------|-------------------------------------------|
|Effectiveness     |When someone is carrying out a task, using the testing tool, how well does it support them to carry out the task confidently, so they know they have not made mistakes, and know they are achieving what they want to achieve, accurately and completely?| H03, H04, H05, H06, H08 |
|Efficiency        |When someone is carrying out a task, using the testing tool, how much effort does it take them to carry out the task?                  | H11 |
|Satisfaction      |Satisfaction is measured as a mix of a person's perception of the usefulness of the product, how much they trust it, the pleasure they get from using it, and the level of comfort they have. When you are designing the test tool, questions you might ask yourself include: <br> *When the person is using the software, how satisfied are they that the software contributes usefully to the task?* <br> *Do people trust the software to be producing accurate results?* <br>   *Does using the software give the person any pleasure?* <br>  *Is the person comfortable using the software?*   <br> Think about how you can provide testers with feedback within the tool that gives positive answers to these questions.  | H02, H03, H04, H10 |
|Freedom from risk | The testers and other stakeholders for the tool will face risks - domain, project, product, from the choice of using or not using the tool. This includes economic, health and safety, and environmental risks. Ask yourself, <br> *Will any stakeholder be more protected or less protected from economic damage?* <br>  *Will any stakeholder be more protected or less protected from damage to their health, safety, life?* <br>  *Will the environment (society, natural world, resource usage, sustainability be more protected or less protected by the use of this tool?* <br> Think about how the tool design will help to mitigate risk.|H01, H09 |
|Context coverage <br> and Flexibility |The tool will be used in a range of contexts - It may not be possible to understand all the contexts completely, your stakeholders may not remember to tell you about all the contexts, but we should make some attempt to understand the possibilities. We also need to understand what level of flexibility is needed in those contexts and for the people using the tool. Ask yourself: <br> *Given everything above, have we thought not just what was explicitly told us, but also asked "where else?" "when else?"* <br> *How much can someone adapt the software to be suitable for themselves?* <br> Think about accessibility needs, people adapting the tool to new contexts, people learning and gaining confidence to use the tool in different ways. Conversely you may want to reduce flexibility if the context has domain risks and restrictions. |H04, H05, H06, H07, H08, H09, H10, H11, H12|
