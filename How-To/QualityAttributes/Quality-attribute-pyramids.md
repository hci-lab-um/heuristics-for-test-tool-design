# Building Quality Attribute Pyramids for UX

<details close>
<summary>Quality Attribute Pyramids</summary>

Once you have a good understanding of *Who* is going to use the tool and *Why*, and their *Context*, you can start to prioritize the quality attributes and identify which technical attributes contribute to the QiU attributes.

For example, if this tool is to be used in a safety critical domain, to manage and report on critical tests, and will be used by people with a range of experiences and skills, you might focus on:
- health and safety as highest priority;
- effectiveness so that people using the tool are able to see they have taken the action they intended;
- built into enhanced operability but deliberately lowered flexibility of workflows;
- learnability supported by a range of learning materials and a training course;
- supported by high levels of reliability and security.

For example, if this tool is to be used in an organization that values a fast time to market, uses agile processes with high team autonomy, you might focus on:
- efficiency of the people using the tool to work at speed;
- flexibility of the workflows to allow teams to tailor workflows to their own needs;
- learnability supported by the tool interface and with a background of easy to access material;
- supported by performance to aid speed;
- supported by maintainability to support change.

In the simple example below, credibility is built on safety and usability. Safety and Usability and built on reliability, security and operability.  Those quality in use and UX attributes and supported by, and support reputation and perosnal relationships.

## Using Radar Diagrams to Compare Persona Quality Requirements

<details close>
<summary>Radar Diagram Examples</summary>

Different personas will have different needs, and different values. The radar diagram shows an example in one project, where the test manager, the automation specialist and a senior stakeholder all had different needs and scored values dofferently when thinking about a particualr tooling requirement. The Test Manager marked trust as a higher concern than the automation specialst, perhaps because the automation specialist understood the tool technically and therefore could trusts its output more. The senior stakeholder was most interested in value for money, while the automation specialist was concerned about flow in their work.

The different values mean that these personas will also rate the quality in use attributes differently for this tool. The automation specialist scored efficiency and extendability most highly; they want to get into a flow in their work. The senior stakeholder may be interested in compliance, legal, and commercial attributes, so scores those more highly. The Test Manager wants certainy in teh reporting and therefore scored effectiveness higher than efficiency. The right balance of these quality in use atributes needs to be found between the personas' requirements.

You can use this quality attribute pyramid method to help you enrich your [personas when you build them](../How-To/Activities/Persona-Building.md). And the quality attributes will help you specify what the personas want and need from the tool.
