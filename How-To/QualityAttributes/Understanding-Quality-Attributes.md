# Quality Attributes

[◄ Go back to README file](../../README.md)

[◄ Go back to Quick Start Heuristics page](../../How-To/Navigate-idea-t/QuickStart.md) 

The purpose of this page is to help you prioritize which quality attributes are important for your tool, depending on your answers to the different heuristics. This is based on evidence in the research data. You can use the quotes and the data to help you build your requirements - in particular to strengthen your context description and personas.

This page links to tables of heuristics and attributes, and to an activity page:
- [Table of Heuristics with Quality in Use and Product Attributes Associated](Table-Heuristics-to-QiU-Attributes.md)
- [Table of Quality in Use Attributes with Heuristics Associated](Table-QiU-Attributes-to-Heuristics.md)   
- [Table of Product Qualities with Heuristics Associated](Table-Product-Attributes-and-Heuristics.md)

## What are Quality Attributes and How to Apply Them?

<details close><summary>Click for an explanation of quality attributes</summary>
 
Quality attributes are properties of a product which affect how well the product performs. Generally, a software system but it could be some other product or service.  
Some of these are Quality in Use attributes: they refer to attributes that are a measure of how good the experience is when using the product. They include the effectiveness and efficiency with which someone can carry out their task, their safety, and the flexibility with which they can work. 
Others are technical or Product attributes which are built into the product and which the building blocks contributing to how the quality in use is achieved. They include functionality, usability, performance, security, and many others.

### How the idea-t heuristics relate to the attributes
<details close><summary>Click for an explanation of how the heuristics relate to the attributes </summary

The idea-t heuristics are based on research data, which included data about which quality in use and product attrbiutes are most important to testers when considering their test tools. These tables explain the attrbutes, and link the attrbutes to the heuristics>

## Usability, Quality in Use, and the User Experience: how they relate together

<details close>
<summary>Usability, Quality in Use, and the User Experience: how they relate together</summary>

Quality in Use (QiU) and Usability had the most frequent mentions in our data. 
Understanding how the different attributes are building blocks to the overall user experience (UX) helps us to design in a better UX, shown in the flowchart below. 
A good User Interface (UI) is supported by interaction design, and contributes to usability, which also includes designing for the users' efficiency, effectiveness, support to meet their goals in their context. 
Usability is one contributor to quality in use, which also includes flexibility in use and freedom from risk. 
QiU is also supported by all the technical attributes, such as maintainability, performance, security. 
QiU contributes to UX, and design should address trust, credibility, flow through tasks and the usefulness of the product. 
All of this, influenced by past experiences, mental models and personal circumstances leads to the lived experience, and gives rise to emotions.

### Quality Attributes in the Research Data
<details close>
<summary>Click here to see research background to the quality attributes information</summary>
What makes a tool successful is definitely not just its functionality. Here’s some data and quotes from the research:

- 98% of the participants mentioned usability and quality in use of the tools as a concern, issue, or necessity. Over 40% of the comments were about usability. <br> *``I first had to define the fields (name, data type, etc.) Then somewhere else in the admin UI, I had to configure where this field would appear on the test case form for the project. Then somewhere else again in the admin UI, I had to define the set of possible values for the dropdown fields I’d added. [. . . ] infuriating (and requires a re-learn [of] this ridiculousness every few months when I get such admin requests).”*
- 91% of the participants mentioned other attributes including functionality, making up 34% of the comments. <br> *“every time I have to deal with a new tool, it’s the matter of installation that is the most difficult.''*

Usability is a key contributor to QiU, and is multi-faceted. Breaking down the comments and concerns on usability we found that operability is the most important usability factor for our participants, followed by learnability, and being supported to meet their goals. 
Other attributes appeared less often. That doesn't make them less important - it just means that for our participants they are not currently their biggest concern.
The other attributes were mentioned often in the context of a problem that adversely affecting the overall user experience. 
In the tables of attributes and heuristics, the attributes are listed in order of frequency measured by how many people mentioned them, and how often.  
Notice how low in the list functionality comes; people don't want more functionality; they want the overall experience to be better for the functionality supplied. 
Similarly, user interface aesthetics were mainly mentioned as an irritation sometimes disguising what became a poor overall experience.

<summary>How the research revealed the figures</summary>

The research to find these figures included several rounds of data collection and analysis, shown in the flowchart below.
Data was collected in interviews, workshops, and surveys with test practitioners. 
The data was analysed using a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods, and re-analysed by a second pair of researchers to check that the results matched.
The analysis results were synthesised into several outputs, including this repository of heuristics. 
The heuristics have been evaluated in reviews with test, UX and accessibility experts.

### Building Quality Attribute Pyramids and Radar Diagrams to get to the Desired UX

<details close> <summary> Click here for an activity to help you work with attributes </summary>

The quality attributes information can be used with the heuristics to understand which product attributes are required in order to deliver quality in use for particular personas, and how to do this is described in an [Activity to Build Quality Attribute Pyramids and Radar Diagrams to get to the Desired UX for Different Personas](../../How-To/Activities/Building-Attribute-Pyramids.md)

## Standards and Reference Texts

<details close>
<summary>Standards and References</summary>

[Summary of ISO 20510 from TMAP with links to additional attributes](https://www.tmap.net/wiki/quality-characteristics)

[Summary of the ISO/IEC 25000 series of standards](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards)

[ISO 25019 portal](https://www.iso.org/standard/78177.html)

NB: even as I write this, new standards are being developed, published, and discussed meaning there are several ways of dividing up the quality in use and product quality attributes. 
On this page, I have provided a simplified summary of some of the main quality attributes, plus notes from the research data. 
You can of course go to buy the new standard, [ISO 25019](https://www.iso.org/standard/78177.html) which has different definitions.
Or use this summary from TMAP of the previous version ISO 25010 with their additional definitions for AI and sustainability [Summary of ISO 20510 from TMAP with links to additional attributes](https://www.tmap.net/wiki/quality-characteristics).
