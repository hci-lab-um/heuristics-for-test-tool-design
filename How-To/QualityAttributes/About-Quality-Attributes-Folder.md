# About the Quality Attributes Folder

This folder contains documents with research results about quality attributes and tables that link the idea-t heuristics to quality attributes, and from quality attributes back to the heuristics.

The quality attributes are based on ISO25010, but have been added to with attributes identified by research participants.  

There are two groups of quality attributes: quality in use attributes and product quality attributes.

- [table linking each quality in use attribute to the most relevant heuristics](Table-Q0U-Attributes-to-Heuristics.md)

- [table linking each product quality attribute to the most relevant heuristics](Table-Product-Attributes-and-Heuristics.md)

  
There are activities to help you work with quality attributes in the [Activities folder](../Activities/About-Activities-Folder.md)
