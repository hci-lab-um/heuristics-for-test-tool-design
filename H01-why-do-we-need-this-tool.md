Theme: WHY?

Heuristic Question: Why do we need this tool?

## Explanation and subquestions

**Why** is this heuristic useful? We found nearly a third of comments made about challenges with implementing tools successfully were management and organizational in origin, and were often about conflicting goals across the organization. A mutual understanding across stakeholders of why the tool is needed, what goals it supports, and importantly what goals it doesn't - or cannot - support is vital. 
You've embarked on designing, building, or choosing a new tool to help support testing.  
Think about:

-	what problem the tool is intended to solve, and whether a tool is the best option for solving that problem. 
-	the people who are testing and the organization, and how their (different) goals need supporting. 
-	enablers and blockers to meeting those goals. 
-	both the testers and the organization have motivations to adopt or to resist a new tool, and these may be the same or may conflict. 

Research Point: In the research leading to the design of these heuristics, we found there are often conflicting goals and expectations for the tools, and different perceptions of what problems needed resolving to enable improvement in working practices. Conflicting or unclear goals mean tool acquisition may be done in a short term mindset. Tools may not even be the solution to the problem you are trying to address.

*``There may be several organizations - even within one organization - with conflicting goals for the same tool [example given of password control tool] Audit versus Dev may have different views about how that might be used''*

*``muddling through - don't have a goal ... just want to do things ... get things done''*

*``change always comes with some resistance, Discussing and setting a clear, shared goal we got a better understanding and purpose to find energy and time and money to finish the transition''*

*`` I would suggest we stop seeing tools as our main goal that will save us, or do the job for us''*

Key questions to ask yourself:
-	Is there a problem to solve?
-	Is it organizational or technical or something else?
- Can you design to increase productivity?
-	Can you design to reduce risk and increase value?
-	Can you design to improve the reach and certainty of people’s work?
-	Will this tool support what we are doing/want to achieve?
-	Does use of this tool cause any breach of ethical goals?
-	What is missing from the existing toolset?
-	Why does the tester need the tool?
-	Why does the organization want the tool?
-	Are there contradicting goals from different parts of the organization?
- What happens if (part of) the tool is not used?

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions
**How** will you go about answering heuristic question H01? To understand why you are building the tool, you need to consider goals for different stakeholders – including yourself.

You will need to iterate between H01 *“Why?”* and H02 *“Who?”* as you identify stakeholders and their goals.

We have tabulated the [Quality in Use and Product Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md) in a priority order based on the input from industry practitioners during our research. Use that data to help you focus on the optimal product attributes to meet the QiU/UX goals for your tool. We've included quotes from practitioners that you can use to help you understand your own goals, stakeholders, and contexts, plus a cross reference between the heuristics and the quality attributes.

There are many activities you might find useful to help you understand *Why* you need this tool and here are some links to typical activities, which include:
-	[SWOT analysis](Technique-SWOT-Analysis.md)
-	Gap Analysis helps understand what is missing and what's needed to get where we want to be: See [Wikipedia Gap Analysis page]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_analysis) for an overview, and [Techtarget have a page on Gap Analysis](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/gap-analysis)
-	Contextual Inquiry is the study of people working in context to understand what they do and why. See [Wikipedia Contextual Inquiry page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry) for an overview, and [Think Design have a page on Contextual Inquiry](https://think.design/user-design-research/contextual-inquiry/)
