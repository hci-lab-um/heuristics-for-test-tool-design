# 12 heuristic questions to provoke thought and ideas when designing or choosing a test tool (quick start).  

On each heuristic below, the "about" link on each heuristic question takes you to additional information including explanations, sub-questions, usage scenarios. The quality in use and prodcut quality attributes are attributes that of the tool that you may need to consider, and "Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes" link takes you to more information about those attributes.

## H01: Why?	

Why the tool is needed, what goals it supports, and what goals it doesn't support. What problem the tool is intended to solve, and if a tool is the best option for solving the problem.

- [About H01. Why do we need this tool?](H01-Why-do-we-need-this-tool.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Freedom from Risk
- Product Quality Attributes: User goals, Appropriateness
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)
  

## H02: Who? 

Who (else) will use the tool? Who provides information for inputs? Who uses information from outputs?	

- [About H02. Who will use or be affected by the tool?](H02-Who-will-use-or-be-affected-by-this-tool.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Satisfaction
- Product Quality Attributes: User goals, Appropriateness
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)

## H03: Experience? 

What previous experiences, expectations and skill levels do people bring? Testers do not conform to IT worker stereotype in their experiences.	

- [About H03. What previous experiences do people bring to the tool?](H03-What-previous-experiences-do-people-bring-to-the-tool.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Effectiveness, Satisfaction
- Product Quality Attributes: Learnability, Appropriateness, User error protection, Recognizability
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)



## H04: Communication needs?	

People have different communication styles. Media, speed, level of detail, accessibility needs, and so on change how people want to receive and impart information.	

- [About H04. What communication needs or preferences do those people have?](H04-What-communication-needs-or-preferences-do-those-people-have.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Effectiveness, Satisfaction, Flexibility
- Product Quality Attributes: Learnability, Accessibility, Rcognizability
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)


## H05: Mastery or Task learning? 	

People may want to master the tool/become expert or just to learn enough to enable them to complete a specific task. Consider both by personal choice and organizational pressure.	

- [About H05. Do these people want "tool mastery" or "task completion"?](H05-personal-learning-goal-mastery-or-task-based.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Effectiveness, Flexibility
- Product Quality Attributes: Learnability, User error protection
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)


## H06: Learning preferences?	

Solo, pair or group learning? Video, audio, text, diagrams? Online or face to face? Guided or exploratory?	

- [About H06. What learning preferences do those people have?](H06-What-learning-preferences-do-those-people-have.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Effectiveness, Flexibility
- Product Quality Attributes: Learnability, User error protection, Recognizability
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)


## H07: Where?

Location affects availability of the tool. Offices, at home, on customer site, countries / time zones, behind firewalls, indoors, outdoors, quiet or noisy environments.	

- [About H07. Where will the tool be used?](H07-Where-will-the-tool-be-used.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Context coverage
- Product Quality Attributes: Operability
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)


## H08: Workflows?	

Workflows describe the steps people take to complete a series of tasks. Workflows include tasks supported by the tool, and also tasks upstream and downstream from the tool.	

- [About H08. What workflows will the tool be part of?](H08-What-workflows-will-the-tool-be-part-of.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Effectiveness, Context coverage
- Product Quality Attributes: Operability, User goals, Appropriateness, Maintainability, Functionality, Security, Compatibility, Recognizability
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)


## H09 Risks?

The domain and technology, as well as the organizational culture will affect the level of risk that people face, affecting their approaches, and the support they need from tools. 	

- [About H09. What risks are associated with those workflows?](H09-What-risks-are-associated-with-those-workflows.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Freedom from Risk, Context coverage
- Product Quality Attributes: Operability, Appropriateness, Performance, Maintainability, Reliability, Scalability
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)


## H10 Autonomy?	

Organizational culture, autonomy and authority; supporting solo, pair /group work; teamâ€™s confidence in their process (maturity, assurance, experience level, skills).	

- [About H10. What autonomy of work styles is allowed in those workflows and teams?](H10-What-autonomy-of-work-styles.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Context coverage, Flexibility, Satisfaction
- Product Quality Attributes: Operability, Accessibility, Maintainability, Security
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)


## H11 When?

Level of urgency during the SDLC, speed a person can work with the tool (blockers, accessibility), staging of tasks in the workflow (learning and retaining knowledge). 	

- [About H11. When will the tool be used?](H11-When-will-the-tool-be-used.md)
- Quality in Use Attributes: Efficiency, Context coverage
- Product Quality Attributes: Operability, Accessibility, Appropriateness, Performance, Maintainability, Compatibility, Reliability, Recognizability
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)
