# About the Publications Folder

The publications folder contains academic publications and papers, plus presentation packs, about the research.

Academic Papers are linked to in the [preprints list within the About the Research folder](../About-the-research/preprints.md) and this includes links to the published versions of academic papers. Sometimes the published version is behind a publisher's paywall, and so links to preprints are also given.

The [About the research folder](../About-the-research/About-the-research.md) also has links to recordings of presentations, webinars and podcasts.

This folder has links to pdf downloads of slides for presentations about the research given at industry events:

[Breaking Tester Stereotypes](presentation-BreakingTesterStereotypes.pdf)

[Heuristics for tools](presentation-Heuristicsfortools.pdf)

[Do you think a new tool will help?](presentation-Oredev2024-thinkanewtoolwillhelp.pdf)

Materials for a workshop to start using idea-t which you can download and use is in the [Downloads folder](../Downloads/About-Downloads-Folder.md)

Additional downloads, publications and links to talks will be added as they become available.
