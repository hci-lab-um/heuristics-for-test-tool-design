# Stakeholder Mapping

## Description
Stakeholder mapping: within an organizational or team system, identifying interested parties for an intended change. 
NB: system here is not the IT system; the IT system will be part of the overall organizational system. The introduction of a testing tool is a change to the system of software development and testing currently used in the organization.

Helps to answers the heuristic question H01: “Who will use or be affected by this tool?”

There are many techniques for stakeholder analysis, which you choose depends on the importance and complexity of the situation you are wishing to understand, and the time you have available. 

These are probably the clearest and simplest of the articles that I have found so far: 
-	[Stakeholder Analysis for Influence on Your Work](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/stakeholder-analysis/)
-	[Interaction Design Foundation on Stakeholder Mapping](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/map-the-stakeholders)

You can find more detail here:
-	[Wikipedia Stakeholder Analysis]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_analysis) The salience model on this Wikipedia page could be useful for a whiteboard exercise to identify stakeholders and map them according to their legitimacy, power and urgency.
  
The onion model is a way to map stakeholders and grouping stakeholders by the way they potentially benefit from the product in question – in this case the proposed new test tool – with each circle of an onion diagram showing different technical, socio-technical, and social zones of the entire system. 
-	[Stakeholders Without Tears](https://www.scenarioplus.org.uk/papers/stakeholders_without_tears/stakeholders_without_tears.htm)
-	NB There is no specific Wikipedia page on Onion Model for Stakeholders at time of writing. 

Standard [ISO 25019](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:25019:ed-1:v1:en) has a description of stakeholders which resembles the Onion Model. In the standard, stakeholder analysis is described: *“stakeholders influenced by use of system or product are classified and explicated"* and *"aspects of interest for each stakeholder are integrated and shown as quality characteristics"*;
-	NB There is no specific Wikipedia page on ISO 25019 at time of writing. 

Value Chain Mapping is a way of understanding the value *to* stakeholders *of* activities done in order to deliver a service or goods. We can link **H01 Why?** to **H02 Who?** by understanding *what gives value to whom*.
-	[Wikipedia Value Chain]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain) in particular the virtual value chain concept of information chains that add value.
-	[Innoq on Quality Value Chain Mapping](https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/2021/10/quality-value-chain-evolution/)
-	[Wardley Mapping]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map) is a specific method for value chain analysis; see also [Learn Wardley Mapping](https://learnwardleymapping.com/)

## Rationale
### Research evidence
We found evidence that stakeholders for tools, whether choosing or using a test tool, did not always feel "heard" and understood by the people supplying the tool. Stakeholder analysis enables you to understand who to communicate with, both to listen and to impart information. 

### When to use this technique
Always map your stakeholders in some way - in particular thinking about *"who haven't I considered?"*
Start with the simplest methods (nearer the top of this page) and use the more detailed methods when you find the need for more information.

### Advantages
Makes sure you have considered different groups of stakeholders, and the level of influence they have on your design decisions.

### Disadvantages
Some of the methods are more difficult to apply, and may be more than is needed if your situation is not complicated.
