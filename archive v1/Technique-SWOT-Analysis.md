## Description
**SWOT** stands for **S**trengths **W**eaknesses **O**pportunities **T**hreats.

SWOT analysis is used to identify the context within which an organization is setting goals, and to identify whether the context and desired goals match together. It can form part of a larger gap analysis study, or be done as a rapid way to identify targets for change and improvement.
It is often run as a workshop, with a white board divided into four sectors. A goal that requires discussion is set as the topic for the SWOT. Participants identify and add strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats concerned with this goal to the board. The group discuss them.

A SWOT analysis is a way to structure a discussion around the goals for a tool:
- We are trying to answer the question "why do we need this tool?" and this is simple way to start;
- We can use the SWOT to help us understand the goal for the tool:
    -  What weakness or threat will a tool help us overcome?
    -  What opportunities will it support?
    -  What strengths will it build on?
    -  What goals (organizational, team, individual) will the tool support?
- Invite a group to discuss the SWOT (Decide which stakeholders to invite. Maybe start small and be prepared to revisit this exercise);
- Set up the SWOT matrix on a whiteboard, flipchart or similar
- Set some rules for how the workshop will run (e.g. turn-taking for contributions, time box for turn, interruptions protocol, time boxes for workshop sections); 
- Ask people to add ideas in each sector; 
- Ask people to group and rank the ideas everyone has contributed;
- NB: depending on the group you may want to manage this in different ways. Silent post-it filling and ranking? Calling ideas out loud? The dynamics of the group will change what is appropriate.

It can be done as a discussion workshop where different stakeholders can share these different viewpoints and listen to each other.

## Rationale

### Research evidence
We found that testers did not always have the same view of strengths and weaknesses as their organizations, so a SWOT exercise to show different stakeholder views of the SWOT could enable communication about what goals are achievable and useful. 

### When to use this technique
-	To get a quick understanding of areas to improve and protect;
-	To identify places where tools might help or block reaching goals.

### Advantages
Simple and quick to get started. Provokes discussion.

### Disadvantages
Sometimes teams find it hard to turn the SWOT workshop output into actions that happen.

## Where do I find more information?
[Wikipedia SWOT entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) has a good overview including limitations and alternative techniques.

The [CIPD SWOT fact sheet]( https://www.cipd.org/uk/knowledge/factsheets/swot-analysis-factsheet) has a good overview and a list of further references.
