# H6 What learning preferences do those people have?
[◄ Go back](README.md)

Theme: WHO?

## Quick Start:

- Heuristic Question: What learning preferences do those people have?
- Solo, pair or group learning? Video, audio, text, diagrams? Online or face to face? Guided or exploratory?	
- Depending on the person and their preferences a mix of media and teaching methods may be needed in the learning materials.
- Quality in Use Attributes: Effectiveness, Flexibility
- Product Quality Attributes: Learnability, User error protection, Recognizability
- [Mapping Heuristics to Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md)



## Explanation and sub-questions

<details close><summary>Click for further explanation</summary> 
  
Think about: 
- Providing learning materials as video, audio, text, pictorial/diagrams.
- Providing learning materials for both solo and team learning.
- Providing learning materials for practical and theoretical styles of learning.
- Online versus face to face learning
- Provide “short burst” and extended learning opportunities.

<summary>Research quotes from testers</summary>

Research Point: we found that people expressed a range of preferences for how to learn – for example whether solo or in pairs, prefer media, whether guided or exploratory AND that these did not necessarily match with their general problem-solving or communication preferences. We also found that people had very little time allowed for learning and development.

*``videos and training courses waste my time ... videos are too slow ... skimming text is quicker''*

*``video over text - small bites''*

*``learning materials not always appropriate [lots of self study in the organization, very narrow in how it manages learning preferences] to read or video [is] too limited / too narrow [they] try to choose one size fits all''*

</details>

Key questions to ask yourself:
- have you considered solo and group learning routes?
- have you considered what mix of theory, practice, guided and exploratory learning is appropriate?
- have you considered learning and help materials in different media?
- have you considered both face to face and remote learning?
- have you considered how mentoring, coaching, listening and doing might be included?
- have you considered how self-help learning might be used?
- have you considered how to train the trainers, coaches and mentors?
- what might affect people's learning preferences because of situational, temporary or permanent access needs or disability?
- what else might inhibit or enhance their learning? 

## Activities, tools and techniques to help answer the questions

To understand *Who learns how* you need to understand their different learning preferences.  
Some people prefer solo and group/pair learning.  People will need theory, practice, exploring, and guided learning. People may have preferences or needs for different media.
For your personas you could ask a representative group if they prefer team or solo learning, and what mix of exploratory versus guided/theory learning they prefer, or you could provide a range of answers across your personas.

<summary>Mini usage case 1 solo or pair learning?</summary>

In one trial of the heuristics, we asked a group of people who were choosing a tool to enable their team to work together about learning and problem solving preferences. We found a wide range of preferences across solo and group learning, and that these were not the same as problem solving preferences. The graph shows that some of the people in the group preferred to learn solo, even if they preferred team problem solving. Similarly there was a range of responses to whether learning was best done practical/exploratory or guided/reading/theory. Note that this is true for this specific group; it may not be generally true.  


![graph shows preference for learning solo or team drop from 40% preferring solo learning down to none preferring all team learning. Preference of 50% of participants to have mix of learning by doing and through theory. Problem solving preferences are more team based and about the same for exploratory versus guided/theory.][learningpref](learning-pref-graph.jpg)

To get the results in the graph above, we asked four questions on a Lickert Scale:

- 	when learning something new	do you prefer learning more solo	or more in a team?
- 	when solving problems	do you prefer problem solving more solo	or more in a team?
- 	when learning something new	learning do you prefer more doing/ practice	or more reading/theory?
- 	when solving problems	do you prefer problem solving more by exploring/doing	or more by following theory/rules?

<summary>Mini usage case 2 self-service or coaching? </summary>

In one case study, in a large organization, with 5000 engineers and 40 automation engineers, a participant discussing this heuristic said that, in their context, it is very hard to know how to deliver appropriate training and appropriate succession planning: *'With the proportion of automation engineers to testers and to developers  'coach the coach' sessions prove most useful.'* In this context, the question *'where do we target hands-on learning?'* is an important one because of the practicalities of scaling training across multiple offices and locations in a large team. *'While self-service training is logistically easier to organize, it may not be optimal for knowledge transfer and confidence: Self Service training is the preferred approach, but is it the best for learning? Not sure. Some people love self-serve learning as they can control the pace, other prefer hands-on impact.'*

We have a [worked example of using this heuristic in persona development](Technique-Personas-and-Archetypes.md).

We have tabulated the [Quality in Use and Product Quality Attributes](Qualityattributesv2.md) in a priority order based on the input from industry practitioners during our research. Use that data to help you focus on the optimal product attributes to meet the QiU/UX goals for your tool. We've included quotes from practitioners that you can use to help you understand your own goals, stakeholders, and contexts, plus a cross reference between the heuristics and the quality attributes. **These may help wth persona development.**

Other Activities: 
- Use what you have discovered about [communication styles in H04](H04-What-comunication-needs-or-preferences-do-those-people-have.md) to inform both the media and the formats in which you supply learning materials.
- If you have not worked with learning preferences, here is an article which may help you enrich your persona definition with [learning preferences](https://cultivatedmanagement.com/two-learning-styles/).
